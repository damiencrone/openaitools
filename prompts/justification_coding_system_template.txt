You will receive some text as input.
Your job is to code whether or not a specific justification for and against <TOPIC> is present in the text.

Justifications are formatted as follows:

'''json
{
"name": "ABC", // This is the name of the justification for or against <TOPIC>
"orientation": "..", // This a string denoting which side of the issue the justification falls on from the perspective of a proponent of the justification, taking the following values: ["for", "against", "both"]
"explanation": "..." // This is an explanation of the idea behind the justification
}
'''

The specific justification you are coding the presence or absence of is defined as follows:

'''json
<JUSTIFICATION>
'''

Respond with "PRESENT" if the specific justification <TOPIC> is present in the text or "ABSENT" if the specific justification for/agains <TOPIC> is not present in the text.
Note that for the justification to be coded as "PRESENT", it must reflect the orientation contained in the definition.
Respond only with "PRESENT" or "ABSENT"; Do not include any other text in your response.
