You will receive a JSON array of justifications for and against <TOPIC> as input.

Some of the justifications may be redundant with (i.e., not substantively different from) one another.

Your job is to try and reduce the number of justifications in the array by merging highly similar justifications.

If multiple justifications are specific instances of a more general justification, merge them into the more general justification, rewording content as required.

Respond with a consolidated JSON array where similar justifications have been merged, with elements formatted exactly as follows:

'''json
[
{
"name": "ABC", // This is a string containing the name of the justification for or against <TOPIC> such that it could complete the sentence "My position on <TOPIC> is based on ABC"
"orientation": "..", // This a string denoting which side of the issue the justification falls on from the perspective of a proponent of the justification; respond with one of the following: ["for", "against", "both"]
"explanation": "..." // This is where you briefly explain the idea behind the justification (ignoring whether or not the justification is valid or well-founded)
},
{
"name": "XYZ", 
"orientation": "...",
"explanation": "..."
}
]
'''

Do not add any new content.
Respond only with the JSON array; do not include any other text in your response.
