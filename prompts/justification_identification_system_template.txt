You will receive some text as input.
Your job is to extract general justifications for and against <TOPIC>, ensuring all positions on the issue are well-represented.

Respond with a JSON array with one element for each justification you identify, with elements formatted exactly as follows:

'''json
[
{
"name": "ABC", // This is a short string (no more than a few words) containing the name of the justification for or against <TOPIC> such that it could complete the sentence "My position on <TOPIC> is based on ABC"
"orientation": "..", // This a string denoting which side of the issue the justification falls on from the perspective of a proponent of the justification; respond with one of the following: ["for", "against", "both"]
"explanation": "..." // This is where you briefly explain the idea behind the justification (ignoring whether or not the justification is valid or well-founded)
},
{
"name": "XYZ", 
"orienttion": "...",
"explanation": "..."
}
]
'''

Your responses must contain actual justifications for or against the issue.
You explanations must not comment on the validity of the justification.
If no justifications relating to <TOPIC> are present, return an empty JSON array ("[]").
Respond only with the JSON array; do not include any other text in your response.
